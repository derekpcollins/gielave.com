					<h3>Traffic Calming</h3>
					<p>Some residents have expressed concern with how fast vehicles travel down Giel Ave. – especially considering the number of young children that live on our street.</p>
					
					<p>The City of Lakewood has established a recommended path for nominating a street for <a href="https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/traffic-calming/">traffic calming measures</a>. There is a <a href="https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Appendix-B-Process-Diagram.jpg">five-step process</a> that the city follows once a street is under consideration. Per the cities' established guidelines, <a href="https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Appendix-C-Street-Eligibility.jpg">Giel Ave. is eligible</a> for traffic calming measures and it <a href="https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Table-4.1.2-Eligibility-Requirements.jpg">meets the requirements</a> for being considered.</p>
					
					<h4>How to take action</h4>
					<p>In order for Giel Ave. to be considered for traffic calming measures, the residents need to nominate the street via the online <a href="https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/report-a-problem-concern/">Report a Problem</a> form. The more residents that nominate our street, the higher our chances of being considered.</p>
					<p><a href="https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/report-a-problem-concern/" class="button">Go to the form</a></p>
					<p>The first thing you'll want to do when you go to the Report a Problem page is choose "Traffic Calming" from the "Problem Type" menu:</p>
					<p><img src="assets/img/problem-type-menu-traffic-calming.jpg" /></p>
					<p>The page will then update with a form that you'll need to fill out. The first part of the form asks for your contact information and the second part of the form is about the issue you're reporting &mdash; here's a template for filling in that information:</p>
					<p>For <strong>Location Type</strong> choose "Specific Address" and then enter your address details. For <strong>Nearest Cross Street/Intersection</strong> you can enter "Between Detroit and Clifton". You can skip <strong>Additional Location Details</strong> if you feel the above description is clear enough. For <strong>Description of Problem</strong> you can enter something like the following:</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>I am concerned about the speed of vehicles traveling on Giel Ave. The posted speed limit is 25 mph, however, I've observed vehicles regularly traveling in excess of that speed. The hill at the top of the street where Giel Ave. meets Detroit seems to exacerbate the problem as vehicles build up speed as they come down the hill. I'm particularly worried because we have a lot of young children that live on our street.</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Click/tap the <strong>Submit</strong> button and that's it.</p>
